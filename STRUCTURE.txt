Plus a little of experimentation.


_____________COLORS_____________
Colors components are added before the word and they set the color for
everything after them, unless the color is changed by another color component

Here is a list of all colors
BLACK    "\033[30m"
RED      "\033[31m"
GREEN    "\033[32m"
YELLOW   "\033[33m"
BLUE     "\033[34m"
MAGENTA  "\033[35m"
CYAN     "\033[36m"
GRAY    "\033[37m"

RESET    "\033[0m"

DARK GRAY      "\033[90m"
LIGHT RED      "\033[91m"
LIGHT GREEN    "\033[92m"
LIGHT YELLOW   "\033[93m"
LIGHT BLUE     "\033[94m"
LIGHT MAGENTA  "\033[95m"
LIGHT CYAN     "\033[96m"
WHITE          "\033[97m"

Example:
This will print the "love" in red:
echo -e "I \033[31mlove \033[0mStackOverflow"

Good practice, would be to add a reset escape code at the end of the echo statement
or else the color won't be changed for the next output:
echo -e "I \033[31mlove \033[0mStackOverflow\033[0m"

_____________DECORATIONS_____________
Decorations are added by appending their number after a semicolon with the number of the color
Example: echo -e "\033[31;3mHello\033[0m"
This will print "Hello" in red(the 31) AND in Italic(the 3)


Decorations are stackable, meaning one can make a bold, highlighted and italic text
Example: echo -e "\033[31;3;1;44mHello\033[0m"
This will print a red, italic, bold and blue-highlighted Hello

List of decorations:
(Only their number will be listed, but they of course need the semicolon)

Text Stylings:
NORMAL     0
BOLD       1
DIM        2
ITALIC     3
UNDERLINED 4
BLINKING   5 (We mention it here but most Terminals won't support BLINKING, for more info check https://www.unix.com/shell-programming-and-scripting/97869-how-blink-terminal.html)
REVERSE    7 (Reverses the color of the text and the background, won't be used in the script, just like BLINKING)
INVISIBLE  8 (Won't be used in the script, just like BLINKING and REVERSE)


Text highlight:
BLACK         40
RED           41
GREEN         42
YELLOW        43
BLUE          44
MAGENTA       45
CYAN          46
GRAY          47

DEFAULT       49

DARK GREY         100
LIGHT RED         101
LIGHT GREEN       102
LIGHT YELLOW      103
LIGHT BLUE        104
LIGHT MAGENTA     105
LIGHT CYAN        106
WHITE             107


_____________NOTES_____________
Just know that there is no standardized way of making terminals, when dealing with low level systems
everything depends on what you're working on, so some text styling may not work, and it's not
our fault nor Bash's fault nor yours, it's the terminal's
